---Step 1: Download all files necessary from Github---

Go to the link https://github.com/apieceofbaggage/trashcraftmodpack

Click on “Code”. This will open a dropdown menu, from which you should select “Download ZIP”

Once it is downloaded, extract the files

On macOS: simply double click the downloaded file (trashcraftmodpack.zip) in Finder 

On Windows: right click on the downloaded file in File Explorer and click “Extract Now”

You have now downloaded all necessary files and extracted them to a folder labeled “trashcraftmodpack”


---Step 2: Install Forge---

Open the forge .jar file in the new folder

You will likely be told that it can’t be opened, unidentified developer, bla bla bla

On macOS: press OK, then click on the Apple logo on the top left, then system preferences -> security and privacy, then click “Open Anyway”

On Windows: click on more details, followed by run anyway

It will pop up with the Forge installer. Make sure that it has “Install Client” selected, then press “OK”.

Forge is now installed.


---Step 3: Put the Mods into the Mods Folder in .minecraft---

Open up Minecraft and get into the game itself

Go into options, open up the resource pack selector, and press “Open Resource Packs folder”

To go back into the main .minecraft folder (from the resource packs):

On macOS: press the command key and the up arrow at the same time

On Windows: look at the top of File Explorer to where you see a this looking thing:

Click on “.minecraft”.

Once you are in the main .minecraft folder, you should now see a folder called “Mods”. Go into that folder.

Take the files from the modpack folder and drag them into the “Mods” folder. Do not drag the folder in. Select all of the mods using cmd+a (macOS) or ctrl+a (Windows) and drag them in.

The mods are now ready to use.


---Step 4: Play---

Make sure that to the left of the big “Play” button, it shows the Forge profile that you saw in installations. 

If not, click on that area and scroll until you see the Forge profile, then click on it

You can also use this to get back to Vanilla Minecraft when you’re done.

Press play.

It will take time for all the mods to load up, but not too long.

Now just join the server like any other multiplayer server. The IP is trashcraft.ddns.net
